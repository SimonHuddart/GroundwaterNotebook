    "### Hydraulic Head\n",
    "hydraulic head is elevation head plus pressure head \n",
    "$$ h = z + \\psi $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However we are given the surface elevation of each well above sea level (450m asl) and the depth to water of each well so we can just as easily calculate the hydraulic head by subtracting the depth to water from the surface elevation.\n",
    "$$h = elevation - water \\, level$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pressure Head\n",
    "The pressure head ($\\psi$ or $h_p$) is height of the water above the piezometer measuring point. We can calculate this by subtracting the depth to water from the well depth\n",

    "### Fluid pressure\n",
    "from Eq 2.11 we can see that fluid pressure is:\n",
    "$$ p = \\rho g \\psi + p_o$$\n",
    "or for our purposes:\n",
    "$$ p = \\rho g (h-h_z) + p_o$$\n",
    "since we're dealing with water on earth, we know that $\\rho = 1000\\frac{kg}{m^3}$ and $g=9.8\\frac{m}{s^s}$ and we will work in gage pressure to assume that atmospheric pressure is zero ($p_o=0$).\n",
    "so to calculate the fluid pressure at piezometer a:\n",
    "$$ p_a = 1000\\frac{kg}{m^3}*9.8\\frac{m}{s^2}*(423m-300m)=1,205,400 \\; Pa \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 1.2 \\; MPa$$"
